# Article Summary

In the article linked below, I learned that Git is a popular, open-source system used by the majority of developers to track and manage project code changes. I also learned that Git works in conjunction with GitHub, which is a Microsoft-owned, web-based platform that leverages Git capabilities while facilitating project collaboration. The article also defined key terms as listed below:

commit--save changes

pull request--ask repository manager to accept changes

branch--parallel version of the repository
